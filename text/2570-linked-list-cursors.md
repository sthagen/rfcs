# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Many of the benefits of linked lists rely on the fact that most operations
(insert, remove, split, splice etc.) can be performed in constant time once one
reaches the desired element. To take advantage of this, a `Cursor` interface
can be created to efficiently edit linked lists. Furthermore, unstable
extensions like the `IterMut` changes will be removed.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

From Programming Rust:
> As of Rust 1.12, Rustâ€™s LinkedList type has no methods for removing a range of
> elements from a list or inserting elements at specific locations in a list.
> The API seems incomplete.

Both of these issues have been fixed, but in different and incompatible ways.
Removing a range of elements is possible though the unstable `drain_filter` API,
and inserting elements in at specific locations in a list is possible through
the `linked_list_extras` extensions to `IterMut`.

This motivates the need for a standard interface for insertion and deletion of
elements in a linked list. An efficient way to implement this is through the use
of "cursors". A cursor represents a position in a collection that can be moved
back and forth, somewhat like a `DoubleEndedIterator`. However, mutable cursors
can also edit the collection at their position.

A mutable cursor would allow for constant time insertion and deletion of
elements and insertion and splitting of lists at its position. This would allow
for simplification of the `IterMut` API and a complete LinkedList
implementation.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

The cursor interface would provides two new types: `Cursor` and `CursorMut`.
These are created in the same way as iterators.

With a `Cursor` one can seek back and forth through a list and get the current
element. With a `CursorMut` One can seek back and forth and get mutable
references to elements, and it can insert and delete elements before and behind
the current element (along with performing several list operations such as
splitting and splicing).

Lets look at where these might be useful.

## Examples

This interface is helpful most times insertion and deletion are used together.

For example, consider you had a linked list and wanted to remove all elements
which satisfy a certain predicate, and replace them with another element. With
the old interface, one would have to insert and delete separately, or split the
list many times. With the cursor interface, one can do the following:

``` rust
fn remove_replace<T, P, F>(list: &mut LinkedList<T>, p: P, f: F)
    where P: Fn(&T) -> bool, F: Fn(T) -> T
{
    let mut cursor = list.cursor_front_mut();
    // move to the first element, if it exists
    loop {
        let should_replace = match cursor.peek_next() {
            Some(element) => p(element),
            None => break,
        };
        if should_replace {
            let old_element = cursor.remove_current().unwrap();
            cursor.insert_after(f(old_element));
        }
        cursor.move_next();
    }
}
```

This could also be done using iterators. One could transform the list into an
iterator, perform operations on it and collect. This is easier, however it still
requires much needless allocation.

For another example, consider code that was previously using `IterMut`
extensions.
``` rust
fn main() {
    let mut list: LinkedList<_> = (0..10).collect();
    let mut iter = list.iter_mut();
    while let Some(x) = iter.next() {
        if x >= 5 {
            break;
        }
    }
    iter.insert_next(12);
}
```
This can be changed almost verbatim to `CursorMut`:
``` rust
fn main() {
    let mut list: LinkedList<_> = (0..10).collect();
    let mut cursor = list.cursor_front_mut() {
    while let Some(x) = cursor.peek_next() {
        if x >= 5 {
            break;
        }
        cursor.move_next();
    }
    cursor.insert_after(12);
}
```
In general, the cursor interface is not the easiest way to do something.
However, it provides a basic API that can be built on to perform more
complicated tasks.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

One gets a cursor the exact same way as one would get an iterator. The
returned cursor would point to the "empty" element, i.e. if you got an element
and called `current` you would receive `None`.
``` rust
/// Provides a cursor to the first element of the list.
pub fn cursor_front(&self) -> Cursor<T>;

/// Provides a mutable cursor to the first element of the list.
pub fn cursor_front_mut(&mut self) -> CursorMut<T>;

/// Provides a cursor to the last element of the list.
pub fn cursor_back(&self) -> Cursor<T>;

/// Provides a mutable cursor to the last element of the list.
pub fn cursor_back_mut(&mut self) -> CursorMut<T>;
```

These would provide the following interface:

``` rust
impl<'list, T> Cursor<'list, T> {
    /// Returns the cursor position index within the `LinkedList`.
    pub fn index(&self) -> Option<usize>;

    /// Move to the subsequent element of the list if it exists or the empty
    /// element
    pub fn move_next(&mut self);
    /// Move to the previous element of the list
    pub fn move_prev(&mut self);

    /// Get the current element
    pub fn current(&self) -> Option<&'list T>;
    /// Get the following element
    pub fn peek_next(&self) -> Option<&'list T>;
    /// Get the previous element
    pub fn peek_prev(&self) -> Option<&'list T>;
}

impl<'list T> CursorMut<'list, T> {
    /// Returns the cursor position index within the `LinkedList`.
    pub fn index(&self) -> Option<usize>;

    /// Move to the subsequent element of the list if it exists or the empty
    /// element
    pub fn move_next(&mut self);
    /// Move to the previous element of the list
    pub fn move_prev(&mut self);

    /// Get the current element
    pub fn current(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T>;
    /// Get the next element
    pub fn peek_next(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T>;
    /// Get the previous element
    pub fn peek_prev(&mut self) -> Option<&mut T>;

    /// Get an immutable cursor at the current element
    pub fn as_cursor<'cm>(&'cm self) -> Cursor<'cm, T>;

    // Now the list editing operations

    /// Insert `item` after the cursor
    pub fn insert_after(&mut self, item: T);
    /// Insert `item` before the cursor
    pub fn insert_before(&mut self, item: T);

    /// Remove the current item. The new current item is the item following the
    /// removed one.
    pub fn remove_current(&mut self) -> Option<T>;

    /// Insert `list` between the current element and the next
    pub fn splice_after(&mut self, list: LinkedList<T>);
    /// Insert `list` between the previous element and current
    pub fn splice_before(&mut self, list: LinkedList<T>);

    /// Split the list in two after the current element
    /// The returned list consists of all elements following the current one.
    pub fn split_after(&mut self) -> LinkedList<T>;
    /// Split the list in two before the current element
    pub fn split_before(&mut self) -> LinkedList<T>;
}
```
One should closely consider the lifetimes in this interface. Both `Cursor` and
`CursorMut` operate on data in their `LinkedList`. This is why, they both hold
the annotation of `'list`.

The lifetime elision for their constructors is correct as
```rust
pub fn cursor_front(&self) -> Cursor<T>
```
becomes
```rust
pub fn cursor_front<'list>(&'list self) -> Cursor<'list, T>
```
which is what we would expect. (the same goes for `CursorMut`).

Since `Cursor` cannot mutate its list, `current`, `peek_next` and `peek_prev`
all live as long as `'list`. However, in `CursorMut` we must be careful to make
these methods borrow. Otherwise, one could produce multiple mutable references
to the same element.

The only other lifetime annotation is with `as_cursor`. In this case, the
returned `Cursor` must borrow its generating `CursorMut`. Otherwise, it would be
possible to achieve a mutable and immutable reference to the same element at
once.

One question that arises from this interface is what happens if `move_next` is
called when a cursor is on the last element of the list, or is empty (or
`move_prev` and the beginning). A simple way to solve this is to make cursors
wrap around this list back to the empty element. One could complicate the
interface by having move return a `bool`, however this is unnecessary since
`current` is sufficient to know whether the iterator is at the end of the list.

A large consequence of this new interface is that it is a complete superset of
the already existing `Iter` and `IterMut` API. Therefore, the following two
methods added to `IterMut` in the `linked_list_extras` features should be
removed or depreciated:
- `IterMut::insert_next`
- `IterMut::peek_next`
The rest of the iterator methods are stable and should probably stay untouched
(but see below for comments).

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

The cursor interface is rather clunky, and while it allows for efficient code,
it is probably not useful outside of many use-cases.

One of the largest issues with the cursor interface is that it exposes the exact
same interface of iterators (and more), which leads to unnecessary code
duplication.
However, the purpose of iterators seems to be simple, abstract and easy to use
rather than efficient mutation, so cursors and iterators should be used
in different places.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

There are several alternatives to this:

1. Implement cursors as a trait extending `Iterator` (see the cursors
pseudo-rfc below)

Since the cursors are just an extension of iterators, it makes some sense to
create them as a trait. However, I see several reasons why this is not the best.

First, cursors work differently than the existing `Iterator` extensions like
`DoubleEndedIterator`. In a `DoubleEndedIterator`, if one calls `next_back` and
then `next`, it should not return the same value, so unlike a cursor, a
`DoubleEndedIterator` does not move back and forth throughout a collection.

Furthermore, while `Iterator` is a general interface for many collections,
`Cursor` is very much specific to linked lists. In other collections such as
`Vec` a cursor does not make sense. So it makes little sense to make a trait
when it will only be used in one place.

2. Using the `IterMut` linked list extensions

Insertion was added to `IterMut` in the `linked_list_extras` feature. Many of
these features could be added to it just as well. But, this overcrowds `IterMut`
with many methods that have nothing to do with iteration (such as deletion,
splitting etc.)
It makes sense to put these explicitly in their own type, and this can be
`CursorMut`.

3. Do not create cursors at all

Everything that cursors do can already be done, albeit in sometimes a less
efficient way. Efficient code can be written by splitting linked lists often,
and while this is a complicated way to do things, the rarity of the use case may
justify keeping things how they are.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

- [cursors pseudo-rfc](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pseudo-rfc-cursors-reversible-iterators/386/18)

This rust internals post describes an early attempt at making cursors. The
language was in a different state when it was written (pre-1.0), so details have
changed since then. But this describes several different approaches to making
cursors and where they led.

- Java-style iterators

Java (and other languages) tried to fix this by adding a `remove` function to
their iterators. However, I feel this method would not be the best choice for
Rust (even for specific `IterMut`s like those in LinkedList) since it diverges
from the expected behaviour of iterators.

- [linked list extras issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27794)

Discussion on the issue tracker about how this is currently managed with
modifications to `IterMut`. The consensus seems to be that it is incomplete, and
it is suggested to create a new `Cursor` and `CursorMut` types.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- How will this interface interact with iterators?

Will we keep both `Iter` and `Cursor` types? Implement one with another? I feel
like they should be different things, but there is reason to consolidate them.

- Only for linked lists?

Should we implement this for more collections? It could make sense for other
collections, such as trees and arrays, but the design would have to be reworked.
